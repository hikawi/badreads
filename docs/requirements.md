# Badreads: Requirements

## Summary

This document aims to outline the requirements for a minimum viable product for
a book-tracking website, inspired by Goodreads. It is written as user stories,
instead of a full product specification.

The product's name would be badreads, because it's simply an inferior version of
the product, haha.

## Out of Scope

These features are out-of-scope and will not be worked on until the MVP is done.

- Recommendation or any algorithms to recommend books.
- OAuth2/eKindle/Apple Books integration.
- Friends System.
- Worldwide feed system.

## User Stories

### 1. User

1. As **a user**, I would like to **login to the system with an email address and
   my password** to **use the app**.
2. As **a user**, I would like to **register with the system if I'm not a member
   yet** to **use the app**.
3. As **a user**, I would like to **reset my password if I forgot in the future**
   to **continue using the app**.
4. As **a user**, I would like to **mark books as reading, read, or want to read
   from the catalogue** to **track my book-reading progress**.
5. As **a user**, I would like to **update books reading progress** at any time
   to **track even closer, such as Saturday I read 20 pages, but Sunday I was busy
   and only read 10 pages**.
6. As **a user**, I would like to **see my books progress** to **know how much
   I still have left, such as 60% read on my pages**.
7. As **a user**, I would like to **leave a review on books read** so that I can
   **share with the world what books I read**.

### 2. Administrator

1. As **an admin**, I would like to **manage all books in my catalogue** so that I
   can **add new books, or edit existing books to keep up**.
2. As **an admin**, I would like to **manage all users** so that **I can ban or
   edit users' credentials (except passwords) if things go wrong**.
3. As **an admin**, I would like to **use all of user's features** so that **I
   can share my books-tracking stats as usual**.
